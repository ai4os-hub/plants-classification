title: Plants species classifier
summary: Classify plant images among 10K species from the iNaturalist dataset.
description: |-
  The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number of fields [1], primarily linked to image and speech recognition. The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) [2] has resulted in a reliable way to compare top performing architectures.
  The use of deep learning for plant classification is not novel [3, 4] but has mainly focused in leaves and has been restricted to a limited amount of species, therefore making it of limited use for large-scale biodiversity monitoring purposes. 
  This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for plant identification using images. The architecture used is an Xception [5] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow. A detailed article about this network and the results obtained with it can be found in [6].
  The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.
  The original training dataset was the great collection of images which are available in [PlantNet](https://identify.plantnet.org/) under a Creative-Common AttributionShareAlike 2.0 license. It consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe. These species are distributed in 1500 genera and 200 families.
  A new iteration of the application has been trained using plant images from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/). This dataset has around 4.4M observations with 7M images from 58K worldwide species. We have restricted our training to the 10K most popular species.
