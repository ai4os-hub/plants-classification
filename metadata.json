    "description": [
        "The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number of fields [1], primarily linked to",
        "image and speech recognition. The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale",
        "Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) [2] has resulted in a reliable way to",
        "compare top performing architectures.\n",

        "The use of deep learning for plant classification is not novel [3, 4] but has mainly focused in leaves and has",
        "been restricted to a limited amount of species, therefore making it of limited use for large-scale biodiversity",
        "monitoring purposes.\n",

        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for plant identification using",
        "images. The architecture used is an Xception [5] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow. A detailed article",
        "about this network and the results obtained with it can be found in [6].\n",

        "The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with ",
        "the top 5 predictions.\n",

        "The original training dataset was the great collection of images which are available in [PlantNet](https://identify.plantnet.org/) under a ",
        "Creative-Common AttributionShareAlike 2.0 license. It consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K",
        "plant species of Western Europe. These species are distributed in 1500 genera and 200 families.\n",

        "A new iteration of the application has been trained using plant images from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/).",
        "This dataset has around 4.4M observations with 7M images from 58K worldwide species.",
        "We have restricted our training to the 10K most popular species.\n",
